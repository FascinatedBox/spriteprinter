spriteprinter
=============

### Overview

Spriteprinter generates 3d stl files from (24-bit) png files. Spriteprinter puts
each color at a different height, so you don't need a 3d printer that supports
multiple colors at once. You can, instead, instruct your slicer to place pauses
for color changes as needed. Some slicers offer support for automatically
figuring out where to put in pauses for color changing, but I recommend you
check the output against the original image to avoid misprints.

This is a work-in-progress.
